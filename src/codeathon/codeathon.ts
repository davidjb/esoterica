I tell you now "the codeathon is over"
Make sure "your programs work"
Just tell us you're sure!

Make this year great in "2016"
Make next year better in "2017"

Tell us that "we'll see you soon, in "; say next year?

Even I agree "the codeathon was fun"!
Tell us all that "this script Trumps all others"
Donald took down the web site.
America is great.
